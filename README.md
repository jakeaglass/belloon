##Belloon &ndash; Bellarmine College Prep's High Altitude Balloon Project—Code, Schematics, and PCB Layout

Launching in winter of 2016 (targeting January) to ~35km of altitude with a 1600g Hydrogen-filled latex balloon and a sensor package complete with the following:

- Camera (GoPro)
- 144MHz APRS RadioMetrix Radio for telemetry
- GPS tracker (model TBD)
- ATMega CPU (with Arduino bootloader) with SD card for data logging
- Light sensors (for measuring cloud density, UV penetration, and visual pollution and frequencies)
- Gas sensors (a sensor that can detect carbon-based gases and nitrous oxide, some of the worse pollutants in the atmosphere that also cause smog)
- Humidity Sensor
- Temperature Sensor
- Electromagnetic Radiation sensor
- Three-axis gyroscope. 

Once the balloon's payload&mdash;the board and sensors&mdash;is complete, we'll be able to launch and make use of the data collected to study environmental changes in the Earth’s atmosphere. Launch will be carried out with the help of the California Near Space Project, which has volunteered to facilitate the launch and retrieval.
